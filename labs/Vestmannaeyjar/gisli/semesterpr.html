<h2> <span class="mw-headline">"The Walking Talking
Puffin" </span></h2>
<p>I'm going to make A walking puffin out of press fit
componements,
that hopefully will swing his wings wile walking.
Then I'll make a circuit board witch will react to my orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think
I´m going to let the puffin tell the his story wile walking. Which I´ll
have to think about later on, the possibilities are
endless!

<h1> <span class="mw-headline">Time frame for the
Semester Project</span></h1>
<p>To finish this project I need to set some time frame,but for
me to
estimate the time is not to easy but I'm going put up some time frame
anyways.
</p>
<p>-What has to be done-
</p>
<p>The Puffin Structure has to be made.
</p>
<p>The walking unit installed.
</p>
<p>The Legs has to be connected to the walking unit.
</p>
<p>The costume that wraps around the structure has to be seewed.
</p>
<p>The circuit that connects the 1M Flash memory to the at48 and
from that to the speaker board has to drawn up and be made, the circuit
is suppose to be able to store all the programming (the sentenses)that
the puffin is suppose speak.
</p>
<p>Then maybe if there is some time I will make gears that will
connect to the walking unit gears,and that will make the puffin
also move his wings or his mouth maybe.</p>

a puffin but it's A bird..</h3>
