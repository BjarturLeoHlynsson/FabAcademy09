<h1>Replica of A rounded window. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h1>
My family is changing all our wooden window frames to plastic and this
window is the most complicated of them all because it's rounded. <br>
This is
A model of A window that I did to make "the plastic window builders"
work easier, to realise the angles and degrees.<br>
Evry one of the 5 have diffrent angles so I needed to ree measure them
and make evry one with the same angles. <br>
So I made this in about
15minutes and documented it just to show another aspect of Fab Labs
uses.

This is A jewellery tree that I made for my syster &nbsp;and the
bottom is made of wood, but I also have a version that has not A
bottom, it stands on it's own legs that are bit wider.<br>
