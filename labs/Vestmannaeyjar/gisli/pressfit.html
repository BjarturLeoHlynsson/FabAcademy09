<td>This is a project that I made in Fab Academy 09" It was
pretty easy job
fo me beacause I was familiar to the laser machine but the drawing and
plasing the boxes all around to make it pressfit right,that took some
time..,But owerall it was A very fun job,I changed A battery charging
output to run the helicopter with 5v from a 220v output. I started
making it out of 4mm wood now but it's much harder because the wood
bends diffrent and evry 2 are not the same.But soon we will have A fun
toy for kids that they put together by them self and maybe paint and
put motor in it,battery,input,and then they will have A helicopter that
they can either run around and play with or just keep it in their
windows running all the day.
