<li> add (at least) a button to the serial echo hello-world
board
</li>
<li> modify the serial echo assembly program to respond to the
button

<h1> <span class="mw-headline">What I learned wile
doing the project</span></h1>
<ul>
<li> First mistake I made was based on my knowlage of the
modela
machine ,what I did was.. I drew the circuit board in inkskape and
exported to png file. The thing that I did wrong was to take try
printing it directly like I'm use to with cad file. First you need to
write the actual size of the board in inches in the Cad program. That
is the diffrence between taking A cad file into Cad program and taking
A png file.
</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li> The second one I did was that I soldered the "at tiny 44"
the oppisite way.
</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Wile I made my programming cables I connected one of them
wrong and it dident work so I made a new one and it worked.
</li>
</ul>

<h1> <span class="mw-headline">Is it working</span></h1>
<p>Yes It's almost fully functional ,the led is blinking whenever
I press any key and the characters appear on the screen,
</p>
<p>but I'w not got far enough with the button function but I'm
going to make it all work in matters of time.
