<h1>Crawler</h1>
<p>Second idea is to attach a crawler on to the front tire. Attaching a second small wheel in front of the front wheel, and connecting them by a crawler will make it able to lift the front of the chair on to obstacles.</p>
<p>pro's:
<ul>
<li>Steady structure. After attachment it will be able to function without complex movement.</li>
<li>Can use power from wheelchair itself.</li>
<li>Rugged look and feel.</li>

</ul>
</p><p>cons:
<ul>
<li>Less shock absorbing then an air tire.</li>
<li>Sticks out in front of the chair</li>
<li>the back wheels still some way to get over the obstacles as well</li>
</ul>
