<h1>Brainstorm</h1>
<p>First idea was a ramp like structure, mounted to the side of the char. Using a robotic arm, a plateau could be lowered in front of the wheel, making a ramp on to the obstacle. After the wheelchair has passed the obstacle the arm would retract the plateau so it could be used again on a next obstacle.</p>
<p><img  alt="The box is a wheelchair" title="The box is a wheelchair" src="Pictures/chair%20model.jpg" /><br />&nbsp;<br />pro's:
<ul>
<li>universal plateau that allows the chair to go over bumps as well cross gaps</li>
<li>can be stored above the front wheel</li>
<li>adjustable angle for different heights of obstacles.</li>

</ul>
</p><p>cons:
<ul>
<li>fragile arm. When hit it could bent, leaving the device and chair unusable</li>
<li>the device will increase the total width of the chair.</li>
<li>complex movement of arm and ramp</li>
</ul>
