<h1>Slide Rail</h1>
<p>Just found out that the ground clearance of the middle part of the wheelchair is about 8 cm. This will be a problem when you lift the front part of the chair to high. This will cause the bottom of the battery box to get stuck on the doorstep (or other object we are trying to climb)<br />Therefore I'm looking into ways to lift the box, or make it slide over the doorstep, until the back wheels hit the obstacle.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm looking into the possibility to attach a rail at the bottom of the box. this rail could let the box slide over the obstacle without damaging it.</p>
