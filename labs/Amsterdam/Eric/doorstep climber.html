<h1>Doorstep climber</h1>
<p>Project to make public spaces more accessible for wheelchairs.</p>
<p>For the biggest part of my life I've been using a wheelchair to move around. <br />
The electric wheelchair is one of the main inventions for people who are physically challenged, to be able to go wherever they want to go. Since the introduction many people who didn't leave their homes up until then found themselves able to take part in the normal things of live. Through the years the most common chair has evolved into a compact machine, capable of driving arround for about 40 kilometres at a speed of 9.5 kmph.</p>
<p>But unfortunately a lot of spaces haven't evolved around the use of wheelchairs. Many buildings and public parks are still used to people beeing able to climb up some small steps.</p>
<p>To overcome this problem I want to make an attachment to the chair that will enable it to drive over the most common obstacles, like doorsteps and pavements. To acomplish this I was thinking of placing ramps over the wheels that could be slided in front of the wheels, and retracted after use.&nbsp;</p>
