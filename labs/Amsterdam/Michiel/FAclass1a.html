agree with the statements in “On models of reproduction” by Homer
Jacobson for the conditions to be able to create self-reproducing
machines/beings. Put in my own words, you need:</FONT></P>

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="URW Bookman L">The
system can be put together in a systematic way or in a random way. In
case of a random creation process, the building blocks need to have
the property to contain a hard coded design of the eventual system
such that no mistakes can be made. If you want your self reproducing
machine to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances, you might
allow deviations in the construction and permit less constraints on
how hard coded the design is integrated in building blocks. This is
very much according to Darwin's evolution theory: mistakes won't
survive, but improvements will. However the rate of creation must be
balanced with the rate of losses and the life expectancy of it's
creator.</FONT></P>

	An artificial machine: a Robot</B></FONT></P>

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal"><FONT FACE="URW Bookman L">To
do this in an artificial machine, you need to create a kind of robot
that has a building plan of it self contained in its memory. It also
needs to know where to find the resources (materials) it is made of
and need to be able to recognize them. Then he needs the tools (e.g.
cutter, welding iron etc.) to make building blocks and put them
together. For this it needs energy sources. Ideally, it is capable to
allocate or transform energy for it's needs. Finally to complete it's
own creation it needs to transfer the knowledge (data) including the
building plan. Optionally, the machine should be able to repair
itself if it gets damaged. For this function in needs incorporated
sensors to detect fails or damage.</FONT></P>
