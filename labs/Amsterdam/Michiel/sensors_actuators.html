<P><SCRIPT SRC="Sensors,%20Actuators,%20and%20Displays%20«%20Fab%20Academy%20experiences_files/adsense.js"></SCRIPT>The
goal of this class (nr.10) assignment is to “interface an input
device with an output device”.</P>
<P>For this Fab Academy assignment about “Sensors, Actuators and
Displays”, I am building a model of a Segway vehicle. Segway model
will contain a tilt sensor that can mesure the angle of the vehicle
from the vertical. The mode of operation should be that the segway
should stay straight up. If the Segway is falling forward, the motors
should drive it forward such that it remains straight up. Like wise,
if the Segway should fall to the back: the motors should drive the
vehicle backward. All in all it is a control operation that should
balance the Segway vehicle. If one should push the Segway such that
it inclines forward or backward continuously, the vehicle will
continue to drive forward or in reverse. This is the main operation
of the Segway.</P>
<P>I was so inspired by Neil Gershenfeld talk about the stepresponse
sensors that I intend to build such a sensor. In order to fullfil
this assignment I thus have to make the angle detection sensor, and
would like to build the Segway model out of Plexiglass. This can
easily be done with the laser cutter.</P>
<P>I have started to model the the Segway model in Blender. Below an
impressions of the work in progress.</P>

<P>The mechanical design in plexiglass also contains a stand where
the vehicle can be store in rest, and that is also suitable to
calibrate the angle sensor.</P>

<P>The angle sensor is constructed as free hanging half circle (in
3mm plexiglass) that will naturaly be hanging down as the earths
gravity pulls it down. It’s sides will be covered with thin coper
surface. The free hanging half circle is suspended in a circular cage
of plexiglass that is constructed from 4mm plexiglass plates. The
sides of the cage will be covered with thin coper plates as well.
There are two options for the variable capacitor, and hence the
stepresponse, to work:</P>
<P>1). The half circle plate in the middle is disturbing the field of
the two outer plates suficiently to detect an angle change. This is
the prefered solution as it does not require any electrical
connections to the middle moving part.<BR>2). The half cicle plate is
an active connected conductor of the capacitor and should be
connected electically.</P>
<P>Besides the angular sensor, I intend to experiment a bit with
another type of stepresonse sensor: a accelormeter. This sensor will
be build in the front of the vegicle. It will also consist of 3
condensator plates. Those plates will all be active and together
these 3 condensator plates will form 2 condensators. The middle plate
will be a free hanging plate constructed from thin copper and will
move to the front and the back as the vehicle moves. This sensor is
experimental and probably not directly necessary for the operation of
the Segway model.</P>
<P>The mechanical and sensor construction has been drawn completely
in Blender. The laser cutter files have been made by exporting 2D
files from blender in DXF format and importing them in Inkscape. In
Inkscape the DXF files had to be adjusted in size (scale to blender
dimensions), made a path and be combined, and the line width (stroke
style) set to 0,001mm. When cutting the plexiglass this SVG file will
be imported in Adobe Illustrator. Below you can find the 2D images
used for the laser cutter and the vinyl cutter (to cut the copper
sheets for the condensator sensor plates).</P>

<P>For the electronics I would like to implement this design with the
following materials and constraints:<BR>- 2 DC motors: they should be
able to turn independly (for perhaps later to add functionality) and
run forward and reverse.<BR>- A ATtiny44 microcontroller<BR>- The
angular sensor based on step response (requires 2 ADC inputs and 2
“type?” outputs (or can they both be driven with the same output
step signal?))<BR>- USB communication for calibration of the sensors
(can the ATtiny44 provide for USB communication and do the Segway
control simultaniously?)<BR>- 1 or 2 buttons for switching between
on/of and calibration mode and operation mode<BR>- a 5 volt regulator
and a 9 volt battery<BR>- H-bridge needed for the control of the DC
motor in forward and reverse direction</P>
<P>Next step: design of electronic circuitry based on the above
requirements and development of (assembly) code for the
microcontroller.</P>
<P>To be continued…</P>
